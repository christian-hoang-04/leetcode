# What is Hashing ? 

Hashing refers to the process of generating a fixed-size output from an input of variable size using the mathematical formulas known as hash functions. This technique determines an index or location for the storage of an item in a data structure. 

## Need for Hash data structure 

The amount of data on the internet is growing exponentially every day, making it difficult to store it all effectively. In day-to-day programming, this amount of data might not be that big, but still, it needs to be stored, accessed, and processed easily and efficiently. A very common data structure that is used for such a purpose is the Array data structure. 

Now the question arises if Array was already there, what was the need for a new data structure! The answer to this is in the word "efficiency". Though storing in Array makes O(1) time, searching in it takes at least O(log n) time.
